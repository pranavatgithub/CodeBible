relative
------------

normal flow will follow. if u place 3 div ,
<div>A</div>  1 full width block
<div>B</div>  1 full width block
<div>C</div>  1 full width block

but u can use some props instead -- top ,left , right

absolute
------------

it will take this element from the container.so no space will be taken in container
<body>
<div class="a">
    <div class="b">HEllo</div> if it is absolutely positioned it will move to top left of its parent container(if it is positioned relative/absolute else go up again)
</div>
</body>
so above class b will be top left alligned wrt body

IF class a is relatively positioned then class a will be positioned top left wrt to class a ..Hmm tricky

fixed
---------------

it will stay in accordance with viewport . it will stay in screen even if we scrolled the item
