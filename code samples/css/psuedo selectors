<p>Here is the live example of the above code.<br />
  We have some <span data-descr="collection of words and punctuation">text</span> here with a few
  <span data-descr="small popups which also hide again">tooltips</span>.<br />
  Don't be shy, hover over to take a <span data-descr="not to be taken literally">look</span>.
</p>

span[data-descr] {
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #00F;
  cursor: help;
}

span[data-descr]:hover::after {
  content: attr(data-descr);
  position: absolute;
}
