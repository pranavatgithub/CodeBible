<!--
    Use case :-

    1. if u want to push A in the left & B & C at right what u do??
        add justify-content:flex-end; to parent container
        add margin-right:auto to A.
        so it will  be 
        |A...............BC|
    2. Fill A & B & C in equal width
        select .container > div  & give flex : 1;
    3. B should be twice wider than A & C
        select .container > B  and add flex :2 ; don't remove use case 2 styles OK? it is also required
    4. A & C have no size specs but B should be responsive and take full width
        remove case 2 styles add case 3 styles
    5. A & C are responsive & B is fixed width
        add flex:1 to A and B and remove all flex props from B. 
    6. you know how to allign items using align-items . now i need to allign C in top postion
        select A and give align-self: flex-start;
    7. need to give some width to each A B C but it won't fit into container
        by default flex-wrap:nowrap; so 1 column per row . to overcome this u need to give flex-wrap:wrap;



    flex in depth
    flex : 1;
    means flex-grow:1  <-- extra space distribution ratio 
          flex-shrink:1 <-- default is 1 means it will shrink even if the container is smaller than flex-basis
          flex-basis:1 <-- it is the base width , we can give 100px 

          say container in 500px , A=200 & b= 200px (flex basis value ok?) if flex-grow = 0 extra space 100px will be evident
          if u want to prevent shrinking give flex-shrink:0,
          if u have to make A&B shrink at constant rate and propotion give flex-shrink:1 to both
          if u want to shrink A more than B , give flex-shrink of A to > Bs 
    Order
    order:0 default
    We can order the elems A& B& C
    by default order will be 0 to A,B,C
    if i give order of C to -1 it will be the first one in the list
    if i give A to order 1 it will be the last one in the list
