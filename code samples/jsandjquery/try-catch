try{throw 2}catch(a){ //thrown item is catched
console.log( a ); // 2
}
console.log( a ); //undefined  that means they implemented block scope variable in catch block in ES3 itself , 
//but we got block scope variables in ES6 in the form of let,const etc ,, so sad!

// finally

function foo() {
try {
    return 42;
}
finally {
    console.log( "Hello" );
}
console.log( "never runs" );
}
console.log( foo() );
// Hello -- try finished immediately finally called and function is done
// 42

if i write return in finally it will take precedence over the try block
