//What is explicit scoping
//==========================

function test(a){
    console.log(a);
}
let b = 20;
//========================
//This thing is wrapped inside {} so it is a scope in ES6+ it won't leak out/ it won't affect anyone , crazy right!
//These things are totally treat differently
{
    let b = 10;
    test(b); //10
}
//==========================
test(b); //20 how????
